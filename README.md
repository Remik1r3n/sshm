# sshm
A stupid script, simplifies common SSH commands.

## Installation
For Linux users, It is recommended to install the main script to another location (like /usr/share/sshm/sshm.sh) and the wrapper script to /usr/local/bin/sshm. This way you can run the script from anywhere, and update it easily.

For Windows users, You'll need to install Git Bash (or something whatever provides Bash on Windows) first.

Then you can use `sshm.bat`, Which is a wrapper for `sshm.sh`. Simply add it to your PATH and modify it to specify the location of `sshm.sh`.

## License
You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.
